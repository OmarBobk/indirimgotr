## Markup Structure
The markup is the profit added to the product’s base cost.

### Steps to Structure Your Markup:
1. **Understand Base Costs**
    - Example:
        - Product A (Bluetooth Speaker): 50 TL from supplier.
        - Product B (Phone Case): 10 TL from supplier.

2. **Set Target Markup Ranges**
    - High-demand items: 10%-15%.
    - Niche or premium items: 20%-30%.

3. **Calculate Final Selling Price**
    - Formula:
      ### **Selling Price = Base Cost + (Base Cost Markup Percentage)**
    - Examples:
        - Product A: 50 TL + (50 TL × 20%) = 60 TL.
        - Product B: 10 TL + (10 TL × 30%) = 13 TL.

4. **Incorporate Bulk Discounts (Optional)**
    - Offer discounts for large orders to attract shop owners.
        - Example:
            - Buy 10-20 units: 5% discount.
            - Buy 21+ units: 10% discount.

## Salesperson Commission System

### 1. Fixed Commission Per Sale
- Offer a flat rate for every product sold.
    - Example:
        - Product A: 5 TL commission.
        - Product B: 2 TL commission.

### 2. Percentage-Based Commission
- Provide a percentage of the product’s markup as a commission.
    - Example:
        - Product A: Markup = 10 TL, Commission = 30% → 3 TL commission.
        - Product B: Markup = 5 TL, Commission = 30% → 1.5 TL commission.

### 3. Tiered Commission System
- Higher sales volumes earn a higher commission rate.
    - Example:
        - 1-10 products sold/day: 5% of markup.
        - 11-20 products sold/day: 7% of markup.
        - 21+ products sold/day: 10% of markup.

### 4. Monthly Bonus for Performance
- Reward salespersons for achieving monthly targets.
    - Example:
        - Sell products worth 10,000 TL → Bonus = 500 TL.
        - Sell products worth 20,000 TL → Bonus = 1,000 TL.
